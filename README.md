## Built With

* [React] - Web framework
* [Bootstrap5] - Styling library
* [NPM] - Package Manager
* [Axios] - Used to make API-calls

We chose React beacuse of it is the most popular framework and their are a lot of guides and videos to follow [1]. Even if you are new to web development, you can learn React quickly â€“ as long as you know basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript [2].

When comparing the differences between the frameworks, there are not many major distinctions. Most of them use JavaScript and support modern frontend development.

React is component based, where user interfaces are divided into reusable components. These components encapsulates logiq for a specific behaviour and can be used together to build complex user interfaces. This enables modularity, reusability and maintainability.[3] This suited our needs well since our application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA), where content updates dynamically without full page reloads [4]. React uses Virtual DOM (Document Object Model), which differentiates it fom other frameworks. This is a lighter version of the original DOM, and makes it possible to only update the necessary parts, resulting in better performance than updating the actual DOM [3].






Other frameworks like Angular and Vue follow design patterns such as MVC, which could be beneficial in larger projects, especially if we were building a Progressive Web App (PWA) or working with multiple pages and views. Vue offers better integration with backend frameworks such as Laravel, making it a strong choice for full-stack applications [3], [5].
