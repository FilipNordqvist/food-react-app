## Built With

* [React] - Web framework

We chose React beacuse of it is the most popular framework and their are a lot of guides and videos to follow.

When comparing the differences between the frameworks, there are not many major distinctions. Most of them use JavaScript and support modern frontend development.
React is component based, which suited our needs well since our application is built as a Single Page Application (SPA), where content updates dynamically without full page reloads.
Other frameworks like Angular and Vue follow design patterns such as MVC, which could be beneficial in larger projects, especially if we were building a Progressive Web App (PWA) or working with multiple pages and views.
Vue offers better integration with backend frameworks such as Laravel, making it a strong choice for full-stack applications.
